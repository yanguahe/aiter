# gfx1250 ISA runner

Assemble a hand-written or hand-edited gfx1250 `.s` into a loadable code object
and launch it through the HIP module API. LLVM is used **only as an assembler**
— no IR optimisation, no register allocation, no machine scheduling — so the
instruction sequence that runs is the one in the file.

```
.s ──clang++ -x assembler──> .o ──lld -shared──> .co ──hipModuleLoadData──> launch
                                          └── llvm-objdump ──> order check
```

Run inside the gfx1250 container (`hyg_fyd1`). No new Python dependencies:
the runner calls `libamdhip64.so` through `ctypes`, because `hip-python` is not
installed in that image.

## Quick start

```bash
cd /data/yanguahe/code/wk_sp1/aiter/my_code/isa_runner

python isa_runner.py smoke_gfx1250.s                       # assemble + verify order
python isa_runner.py smoke_gfx1250.s --smoke               # launch exactly once
python isa_runner.py smoke_gfx1250.s --smoke --iters 200 --json

# reassemble the real gemm1 kernel and confirm nothing was reordered
python isa_runner.py \
  ../isa_cmp/w1/gemm_a8w4_tdm_t64x256x256_w1x4_b3_e384_afp8_outbf16_silu_bias1_qout0_qrep1_v1/21_final_isa.s \
  --json
```

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` build/load error, `2` instruction order changed,
`3` smoke result mismatch.

`bash selftest.sh` runs all of the above end to end. Verified on c9-3 /
`hyg_fyd1` / gfx1250: smoke order 13/13, 256/256 elements correct,
~8.4 us per launch, and the 2871-instruction production kernel reassembles in
exact order, loads and resolves its symbol.

## Assembly format

A file must be self-contained — the three blocks below are what make a code
object loadable. `21_final_isa.s` dumps from FlyDSL already have all of them,
so they can be fed in unmodified.

1. **Target + text**

   ```asm
   .amdgcn_target "amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx1250"
   .amdhsa_code_object_version 6
   .text
   .globl  my_kernel
   .p2align 8
   .type   my_kernel,@function
   my_kernel:
       ...
       s_endpgm
   ```

2. **Kernel descriptor** (`.rodata`) — `.amdhsa_kernel my_kernel … .end_amdhsa_kernel`.
   The fields that bite:
   - `.amdhsa_kernarg_size` must match the packed argument buffer exactly.
   - `.amdhsa_user_sgpr_count 2` + `.amdhsa_user_sgpr_kernarg_segment_ptr 1`
     puts the kernarg pointer in `s[0:1]`.
   - `.amdhsa_system_sgpr_workgroup_id_x 1` then puts `workgroup_id_x` in `s2`.
   - `.amdhsa_next_free_vgpr` / `_sgpr` must cover every register used, or the
     dispatch is rejected or corrupts state.
   - `.amdhsa_wavefront_size32 1` for wave32.

3. **Metadata** (`.amdgpu_metadata` … `.end_amdgpu_metadata`) — YAML describing
   args, `.symbol: <name>.kd`, `.max_flat_workgroup_size` and `.wavefront_size`.
   The loader reads this, not the descriptor, when resolving the kernel symbol.

## Gotchas found the hard way

- **`workgroup_id_x` lives in `ttmp9`, not `s2`.** With
  `.amdhsa_system_sgpr_workgroup_id_x 1` you might expect `s2`; on gfx1250 it
  arrives through the trap temporaries. The compiler's own output reads `ttmp9`
  and uses `s2` as scratch. Reading `s2` gave a garbage block offset and a
  page fault (`Memory access fault ... Reason: Page not present`).
- **Guard your stores.** A bad index faults the GPU. The smoke kernel takes an
  `n_elems` argument and masks `exec` before storing; do the same in new
  kernels rather than trusting the launch geometry.
- **`vcc` must be declared.** Using `vcc_lo` requires
  `.amdhsa_reserve_vcc 1`.
- **Trailing `s_code_end` is expected.** `.p2alignl`/`.fill 96, 4, 0xBF9F0000`
  in the source becomes 99 padding instructions; `verify_order` reports them as
  `trailing_s_code_end_ignored` rather than a mismatch.

## Kernel symbol

`hipModuleGetFunction` takes the **kernel name** (`isa_smoke`), while the ELF
symbol is `isa_smoke.kd`. `list_kernels()` strips the suffix, so
`--kernel` always takes the plain name.

## Typed kernargs

Arguments are packed into one buffer with natural alignment and handed over
via HIP's `HIP_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER` protocol. Packing must match the
kernel's kernarg layout byte for byte.

| passed | packed as | align |
|---|---|---|
| `torch.Tensor` | `data_ptr()`, 8 B | 8 |
| `ctypes.c_*` | its own width | `sizeof` |
| Python `int` | **int32** | 4 |
| Python `float` | float32 | 4 |

A bare Python `int` is ambiguous, so anything that is not a 32-bit value must
be passed as an explicit ctypes object — `ctypes.c_uint64(ptr)` for a raw device
pointer, `ctypes.c_float(x)` for an fp32 scalar.

## Grid / block / dynamic LDS

`KernelLaunchSpec(grid, block, shared_mem_bytes, stream, device)` maps onto
`hipModuleLaunchKernel`. `shared_mem_bytes` is **dynamic** LDS and adds to the
descriptor's `.amdhsa_group_segment_fixed_size`.

The gemm1 TDM kernel's profile is recorded in `isa_runner.py` as
`TDM_GEMM1_BLOCK = (128, 1, 1)` and `TDM_GEMM1_LDS_BYTES = 159744`, taken from
`19_gpu_module_to_binary.mlir` (`threads in (%4,1,1)` with `%4 = 128`,
`dynamic_shared_memory_size %3` with `%3 = 159744`). That kernel takes 15
arguments and is **not** launched by the generic runner at this stage;
`tdm_adapter.py` captures its real arguments and performs that launch.
Reassembling and loading it is covered here, which proves the toolchain path
works on a real kernel.

## Verifying nothing moved

Every `isa_runner.py <source.s>` invocation disassembles the built object and
compares its mnemonic sequence with the source before any optional launch.
Operand syntax and `_e32`/`_e64` suffixes are normalised away; an insertion,
deletion or reorder is reported with the index and surrounding context. A
failed order check prevents `--smoke` from launching.

## Iterating on a kernel

1. Copy the `21_final_isa.s` you want to modify.
2. Edit instructions. Keep `.amdhsa_next_free_vgpr`/`_sgpr` ≥ what you use.
3. `python isa_runner.py edited.s` — catches syntax errors and any reordering.
4. Use `tdm_adapter.py replay --which gemm1 --isa edited.s` to launch a real
   TDM GEMM with captured production inputs.

Builds are cached in `~/.isa_runner_cache` keyed by source hash + arch; use
`--force` to rebuild. Binary `.text` patching is only a fallback for same-size
replacement and is not implemented here — editing the `.s` is the main path.

## Running a real kernel: `tdm_adapter.py`

The smoke kernel proves the mechanism; the adapter feeds a hand-edited ISA the
**real** gemm1/gemm2 inputs. Those inputs (preshuffled MXFP8 A, preshuffled
MXFP4 W, n32k4-folded scales, per-expert psum `m_tile_map`) are not practical to
construct by hand — a subtly wrong construction yields a plausible wrong answer.
So the adapter **captures** instead: it patches the FlyDSL launch, runs the
production path once, and records the device pointers the kernel really got.

```bash
cd /data/yanguahe/code/wk_sp1/aiter        # repo root: shadows /app/aiter
K=my_code/isa_cmp/w1/<kernel>/21_final_isa.s

# sanity: compare the unmodified candidate with the captured production gemm1
python my_code/isa_runner/tdm_adapter.py replay --which gemm1 \
    --isa "$K" --out r.json

# edit, then compare the candidate against production
python my_code/isa_runner/make_variant.py $K edited.s --wait-after-wmma
python my_code/isa_runner/tdm_adapter.py replay --which gemm1 \
    --isa edited.s --iters 100 --out r.json
python my_code/isa_runner/show_report.py r.json
```

Production capture and candidate replay must be in the **same process** — the
pointers are device addresses, so a saved JSON is metadata only. `--which
gemm2` selects the no-activation production dispatch and applies the same flow;
the candidate ISA must match the selected kernel's signature and launch shape.
Input generation uses a fixed seed (`--seed 0` by default), applied to Python,
torch, and all CUDA/HIP device generators before the production MoE setup.

### The production kernel is the reference

Immediately before the selected production GEMM launches, the adapter fills its
output with `_POISON` and synchronizes. It then invokes the real production
launch, synchronizes as soon as that launch returns, and clones the output
before the rest of the fused MoE can reuse or modify it. The candidate receives
the captured arguments and its output is filled with `_POISON` again before its
launch.

Padding is detected from the poison masks in the output's original dtype.
This matters for BF16: `-12345.0` is represented as `-12352.0`, so converting
to float before comparing with the source literal would miss every sentinel.
Positions that remain poison in both outputs are skipped. All other positions
are checked: production-written positions still poisoned by the candidate are
reported as `missing_writes`, and candidate writes in production padding are
reported as `unexpected_writes`; either condition fails the run.

The report also includes `output_hash`: SHA256 values for the production and
ISA outputs over their complete raw tensor bytes, including poison padding.
`match=true` therefore means exact byte equality, while the existing `passed`
field remains the numerical correctness gate.

### Gotchas the adapter handles

- **Pin every captured tensor.** `ptr_arg` keeps only a raw pointer, so once the
  production call returns, torch's caching allocator can reuse those buffers
  and replay silently reads freed memory (NaN, not an error). The adapter keeps
  the wrapper tensors alive and resolves `arg_c` back to its live torch output;
  capture fails explicitly if that output cannot be found.
- **Dynamic LDS is computed, not guessed.** `arena_bytes()` mirrors the
  frontend's arena math; it reproduces both the kernel's own `ARENA=158208` log
  and the `dynamic_shared_memory_size 159744` in the MLIR (the same arena after
  the `tile_m<=64` zero-fill rounding). The descriptor says
  `group_segment_fixed_size 0`, so the launch must supply this.
- **Capture the tuned tiles.** The adapter defaults `AITER_TDM_TILE_*` to the
  `g2_m64_nb3` config so the captured kernel matches the dumped
  `t64x256x256_b3` ISA; the CSV default would capture `16x256x256_b2`, which no
  dump matches.
- **Run from the repo root.** The container also has an older `/app/aiter`
  without the TDM kernel.

## Timing

`--smoke --iters N` and the library-level `IsaModule.benchmark()` use HIP
events around a loop of launches, so the number is **dispatch-level** and
includes queue-visible launch overhead. The module stays loaded across
iterations, so load cost is excluded. The smoke CLI uses no hidden warmup:
`--iters 200` launches exactly 200 times.

By default, `tdm_adapter.py --iters N` uses
`aiter.test_common.run_perftest(..., testGraph=False)`, the same path as
`op_tests/test_flydsl_grouped_gemm_gfx1250.py` uses for isolated GEMM timing.
The adapter times both the captured real production GEMM and the ISA kernel
with identical warmup/iteration settings. Their results are reported as
`production_benchmark` and `benchmark`; `benchmark_comparison` reports the ISA
speedup relative to production.

Set `FLYDSL_TIMER=1` to use FlyDSL
`tests/kernels/benchmark_common.py::bench_kernel_us` semantics instead: L2 is
flushed and the output is poison-filled before each launch, a separate torch
CUDA event pair measures each kernel, IQR outliers are removed, and
`per_launch_us` is the median. Pass `--no-flush-l2` for hot-L2 timing in this
mode.

For single-wave cycle counts, put `s_get_shader_cycles_u64` in the ISA itself
and write the delta to a buffer.
